# tc_landingPage
I am going to build a crypto tax calculator web app.

I am following the lessons from the odin project to build a landing page.

The landing page proect by Odin is a guided project. ALthough i will refer to odin's guide when i am stuck, i will not use the provided template for this project.

The page design is fully inspired by wormholes's airdrop claim page.

I aim to integrate what i have learnt about html/css on my landing page.
